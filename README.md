SIH- 2024 PROJECT
# ABOUT
**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on the identification of encryption algorithms used in encrypted data without requiring the decryption of the message. By analyzing ciphertext alone, the system can determine the encryption algorithm employed, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the user's information. This approach is crucial for scenarios where data confidentiality is paramount and decryption is not feasible or desired.

Objective: Identify encryption algorithms used in ciphertext without decrypting the data.

Data Security: Ensures user information remains confidential and secure.

**Features:**

Detects encryption methods from ciphertext.

Provides suggestions for enhancing algorithm security.

Technologies Used: Machine learning for pattern recognition, cryptographic analysis, and secure processing.
